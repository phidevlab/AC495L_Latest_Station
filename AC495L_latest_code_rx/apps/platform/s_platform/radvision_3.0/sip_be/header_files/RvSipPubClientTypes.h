 * General:

 *  PUBLISH request.
 *  This callback is called in the following cases:
 *     - Before there is a need to retransmit a compressed message. 
 *       This happens when the transaction timer expires and, 
 *       according to RFC 3261, the SIP Stack needs to retransmit the message.
 *     - When the sigCompTcpTimer expires. The SIP Stack added a
 *       timer for SigComp TCP transmissions. When this timer expires
 *       the application can send the message again in a plain format.
 *       (According to RFC 3261, there are no retransmission in TCP).
 *  This callback is part of a recovery mechanism. The callback supplies
 *  information about compression type that was used in the last transmission. 
 *  The callback also gives the application the ability to determine if 
 *  there will be additional retransmissions, and the compression type of 
 *  the next retransmission.
 *  For example, the application can decide that the next retransmission 
 *  will not be compressed.
 *  Note: If the peNextMsgComp is set to RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_MSG_COMP_TYPE_UNDEFINED, 
 *	the SIP Stack will stop the message retransmissions.
 *
 * Arguments:

 *            hAppPubClient - The application handle for this pub-client.
 *            hTransc       - The transaction handle.
 *            retransNo     - The number of retransmissions of the request
 *                            until now.
 *            ePrevMsgComp  - The type of the previous not responded request
 * Output:    peNextMsgComp - The type of the next request to retransmit (
 *                            RVSIP_TRANSMITTER_MSG_COMP_TYPE_UNDEFINED means that the
