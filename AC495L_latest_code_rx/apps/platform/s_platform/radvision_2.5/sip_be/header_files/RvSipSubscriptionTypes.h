/* RvSipSubsState
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * RvSipSubsState represents a state in a subscription. The state changes
 * are reported using the RvSipSubsStateChangedEv call back function
 * together with a state change reason that may indicate to the application
 * how the new state was reached
 *
 *  Subscriber States:
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_SUBS_SENT - After calling Subscribe() and sending an initial SUBSCRIBE,
 *                       the subscription enters the Subs-Sent state.
 *                       The subscription remains in this state until it receives
 *                       a final response from the notifier.
 *                       If 2xx class response is received, the subscription assumes
 *                       the Subs-2xx-rcvd state. If 3xx class response is received,
 *                       the subscription moves to the Redirected state. If the
 *                       subscription is rejected with a 401 or 407 response is
 *                       received, the subscription moves to the Unauthenticated state.
 *                       For all other response codes, subscription assumes the
 *                       Terminated state. If a NOTIFY request is received before
 *                       2xx response is received, the subscription assumes the
 *                       Notify-Before-2xx-Rcvd state.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_REDIRECTED - A subscription in the Subs-Sent state may receive a 3xx
 *                       class response. In this case, the subscription assumes
 *                       the Redirected state. At this point, you may confirm the
 *                       redirection by calling the Subscribe() function again.
 *                       You can also decide to terminate the subscription using
 *                       the Terminate() function.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_UNAUTHENTICATED - A subscription in the Subs-Sent state may receive
 *                       401 or 407 response. In this case, the subscription assumes
 *                       the Unauthenticated state. At this point, you may re-send
 *                       your request with authentication information by calling
 *                       the Subscribe() function again. You can also terminate
 *                       the call using the Terminate() function.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_2XX_RCVD - Upon receipt a 2xx response to an initial SUBSCRIBE
 *                       request, the SIP Stack will assumes the 2xx-rcvd state.
 *                       The subscription remains in this state until it receives
 *                       and accept a NOTIFY request from the notifier. SIP Stack set a timer,
 *                       at this state (called no-notify-timer), if this timer
 *                       expires before the notify request is received, the subscription
 *                       assumes the Terminated state.
 *                       When the notify request is received and accepted by application,
 *                       the subscription assumes the Active or Pending state
 *                       (according to the subscription-state header in notify request).
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_NOTIFY_BEFORE_2XX_RCVD - If a notify request is received and accepted,
 *                       while subscription is in state Subs-Sent, the SIP Stack assumes
 *                       the Notify-before-2xx-rcvd state. When subscription receives
 *                       the 2xx response on the subscribe request, it will assume
 *                       the Active or Pending state (according to 200 or 202 response).
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_REFRESHING - A Subscriber subscription in Active state may call Refresh()
 *                       function to send a Refresh subscribe request. After sending
 *                       the refresh, subscription enters the Refreshing state.
 *                       The subscription remains in this state until it receives a
 *                       final response from the notifier.
 *                       If 2xx class response is received, the subscription set the
 *                       subscription timer to the new value that both subscriber and
 *                       notifier had agreed on in the refresh message and 2xx response.
 *                       If a non-2xx response is received, the subscription timer
 *                       remains as it was.
 *                       For both cases, when a response is received for the refresh
 *                       request,  subscription assumes the Active state.
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_UNSUBSCRIBING - A Subscriber subscription may call Unsubscribe()
 *                       function to send an unsubscribe request. After sending the unsubscribe,
 *                       subscription enters the unsubscribing state. The subscription
 *                       remains in this state until it receives a final response from
 *                       the notifier.
 *                       If 2xx class response is received, subscription assumes the
 *                       Unsubscribe-2xx-Rcvd state, for waiting to the notify request
 *                       that terminates the subscription.
 *                       If a non-2xx response is received, Subscription assumes the
 *                       previous state (the state before sending the unsubscribe request).
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_UNSUBSCRIBE_2XX_RCVD - Upon receipt a 2xx class response on an unsubscribe
 *                       request, subscription assumes the Unsubscribe-2xx-Rcvd state.
 *                       The subscription remains in this state until it receives a
 *                       notify request from the notifier with 'Subscription-State:Terminated'
 *                       header in it. SIP Stack set a timer, at this state (called
 *                       no-notify-timer), if this timer expires before the notify
 *                       request is received, the subscription assumes the Terminated state.
 *
 *  RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_MSG_SEND_FAILURE - failed to send a subscribe request, because of a
 *                       timeout, network error, or 503 response. Application may try to
 *                       re-send the request to the next ip address in the DNS list.
 *
 *  Notifier States:
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_SUBS_RCVD - Upon receipt of the initial SUBSCRIBE by a notifier
 *                        subscription, the subscription assumes the Subs-Rcvd state.
 *                        In this state, it is up to the application to decide whether
 *                        to accept or reject the subscription using the subscription API.
 *                        If application accept the SUBSCRIBE request with 200 response,
 *                        it must immediately send a notify(active) request.
 *                        If application accept-pending the SUBSCRIBE request with 202 response,
 *                        it must immediately send a notify(pending) request.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_ACTIVATED - When a notifier subscription wants to move from state
 *                         pending to state active, it sends a notify request with
 *                        'Subscription-State:active" header in it.
 *                         When sending it the subscription assumes the Activated state.
 *                         When notifier receives the 2xx response for this notify
 *                         request, the subscription assumes the Active state.
 *                         If notifier receives non-2xx response for this notify request,
 *                         it remains in state Activated.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_REFRESH_RCVD - Upon receipt of a refresh SUBSCRIBE by a notifier subscription,
 *                         the subscription assumes the Refresh-Rcvd state.
 *                         In this state, it is up to the application to decide whether
 *                         to accept or reject the subscription refreshing using the
 *                         subscription API.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_UNSUBSCRIBE_RCVD - Upon receipt of an UNSUBSCRIBE by a notifier subscription,
 *                         the subscription assumes the Unsubscribe-Rcvd state. In this
 *                         state, it is up to the application to decide whether to accept
 *                         or reject the unsubscribe request using the subscription API.
 *                         If application reject the request, the subscription assumes
 *                         the previous state (state before receiving the unsubscribe
 *                         request). If application accept the request, it must immediately
 *                         send a Notify request with 'Subscription-State:Terminated'
 *                         header in it. When sending this notify request subscription
 *                         assumes the Terminating state.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_TERMINATING - When a notifier subscription sends a notify request with
 *                         'Subscription-State: terminated" header in it, the subscription
 *                         assumes the Terminating state. When notifier receives the
 *                         2xx response for this notify request, the subscription assumes
 *                         the Terminated state. If notifier receives non-2xx response
 *                         for this notify request, it remains in state Terminating.
 *
 *  Common States:
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_IDLE - The Idle state is the initial state of the subscription
 *                         state machine. Upon subscription creation, the subscription
 *                         assumes the Idle state. It remains in this state until
 *                         Subscribe() is called, whereupon it changes to the
 *                         Subs-Sent state.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_PENDING - The pending state indicates that the initial subscribe
 *                         request has been received and understood, but the subscription
 *                         is not necessarily has been authorized yet.
 *                         A subscriber subscription reaches this state when 202 final
 *                         response is received for initial subscribe request, and a
 *                         notify request with pending Subscription-State is received
 *                         and accepted.
 *                         A notifier subscription reaches this state when a 202
 *                         final response is sent for an initial subscribe request.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_ACTIVE - The subscription is active. This state indicates a successful
 *                         subscription establishment.
 *                         A subscriber subscription reaches this state when 2xx final
 *                         response is received for initial subscribe request, and a
 *                         notify request with active Subscription-State is received
 *                         and accepted.
 *                         A notifier subscription reaches this state when a 200 final
 *                         response is sent for an initial subscribe request, or when
 *                         2xx response is received for a notify request with active
 *                         Subscription-State, which was sent on pending state.
 *
 *    RVSIP_SUBS_STATE_TERMINATED - This state is the final subscription state. When a subscription
 *                         is terminated, it assumes the Terminated state. Upon reaching
 *                         the Terminated state, you can no longer reference the subscription
 *                         object using the subscription API function.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Enumeration of a notification object status. (used in RvSipSubsNotifyEv)
  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_REQUEST_RCVD -
        Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request by a subscriber subscription, the notification
        object informs of the Request-Rcvd status. In this state, it is up to the application
        to decide whether to accept or reject the notify using the subscription notify API.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_REDIRECTED -
        Upon receipt a 3xx response to a NOTIFY request, the notification object informs the
        Redirected status. At this stage, application may get needed information from the 3xx
        message. After that, the notification object is terminated and inform the Terminated status.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_UNAUTHENTICATED -
        Upon receipt a 401/407 response to a NOTIFY request, the notification object inform
        the Unauthenticated status. At this stage, application may get needed information from
        the response message. After that, the notification object is terminated and
        inform of the Terminated status.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_REJECT_RCVD -
        Upon receipt a non-2xx response to a NOTIFY request, the notification object inform of the
        Reject-Rcvd status. At this stage, application may get needed information from the response
        message. After that, the notification object is terminated and inform of the Terminated status.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_2XX_RCVD -
        Upon receipt a 2xx response to a NOTIFY request, the notification object inform of the
        2xx-rcvd status. At this stage, application may get needed information from the 2xx message.
        After that, the notification object is terminated and inform of the Terminated status.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_MSG_SEND_FAILURE -
        A notifier who failed to send a notify request (receives a 503 response, transaction timeout
        or network error) informs the Msg-Send-Failure status. At this stage application has to
        decide whether to re-send this message to the next ip address from the DNS list, or to give
        up sending this message.
        If application gives up, the notification object is terminated (and informs the
        Terminated status).
        If application re-sends the request to next ip address, the SIP Stack use the same
        notification object to re-send the notify request.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_TERMINATED -
        This status is the final notification object. Upon reaching the Terminated state,
        you can no longer reference the notification object .

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_IDLE -
        This status is the initial status of a notification object.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_REQUEST_SENT -
        Upon sending a NOTIFY request, the notification object inform of the
        Request-Sent status. At this stage, notification object waits for a response.

  *  RVSIP_SUBS_NOTIFY_STATUS_FINAL_RESPONSE_SENT -
        Upon sending a NOTIFY response, the notification object inform of the
        Final-Response-Sent status.
        After that, the notification object is terminated and inform of the Terminated status.

/******************************************************************************
 * RvSipSubsCreatedDueToForkingEv
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * General: Notifies the application about the creation of a forked
 *          subscription. A forked subscription is created as the result of
 *          the arrival of a NOTIFY message, sent in response to the forked
 *          SUBSCRIBE request.
 *          For information about forking determination criteria,
 *          see sections 3.3.3 and 4.4.9 of RFC 3265.
 *
 *          Using this callback, the application can decide to reject
 *          the creation of the subscription. To do so, it should set
 *          the pRejectStatus parameter to the error code, which will be set
 *          in response to the NOTIFY message.
 *
 *          The forked subscription will not be created if the original
 *          subscription (the one that generated the SUBSCRIBE request)
 *          is configured to disable forking.
 *          See the RvSipSubsSetForkingEnabledFlag() API function.
 *
 *          If the callback is not set by the application, the NOTIFY message
 *          will be rejected with a 481 response according RFC 3265,
 *          and the transaction will be closed.
 *
 *          The application should not call the Subscription Layer API from
 *          this callback. Since it may affect the state of the Subscription
 *          (for example, RvSipSubsTerminate()).
 *
 *          It is recommended that the application disable forking
 *          for the event package of the REFER type. This means that if
 *          a subscriber subscription is created as the result of an incoming
 *          REFER request with a SUBSCRIBE method (the handle of such object is
 *          returned by RvSipSubsReferAccept()), the application should set
 *          the "ForkingEnabled" flag for the object to RV_FALSE (by means of
 *          the RvSipSubsSetForkingEnabledFlag() function).
 *
 * Return Value: any (the returned status is ignored currently - 03/2004)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Arguments:
 * Input:   hSubs       - The handle to the created forked Subscription.
 *          pExpires    - A pointer to the expiration value of the subscription
 *                        This value should be set in seconds. If the value was
 *                        not determined, it will be set to -1.
 *                        The value cannot be determined if it was not set in
 *                        the original Subscription. In this case,
 *                        the application should supply the value to limit
 *                        the life cycle of the forked subscription.
 *                        The RvSipSubsUpdateSubscriptionTimer() function can
 *                        be also used for this purpose. On expiration,
 *                        the expiration callback will be called for the forked
 *                        subscription.
 * Output:  pExpires    - A pointer to the memory where the application can set
 *                        the expiration value.
 *          phAppSubs   - The handle that the application sets
 *                        for the subscription.
 *          pRejectStatus-If Application decides to terminate this Subscription
 *                        it should set the pointer to point to positive
 *                        integer, representing Error Code. In this case Stack
 *                        will respond to the NOTIFY with error code and
 *                        will free Subscription object and

 * RvSipSubsReferNotifyReadyEv
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * General: Indicates that a refer notifier subscription is ready to
 *          send a notify request.
 *          This callback is called after accepting a REFER request, and for
 *          every incoming provisional or final response for the related
 *          object establishment attempt.
 *          When RvSipSubsReferNotifyReadyEv() is called, application should
 *          create and send a new notify request, with status of the establish
 *          attempt of the refer related object.
 *          The response code parameter indicates the response code that should
 *          be set in the body of the NOTIFY message.
 *          The function also provides the incoming response message of the
 *          establishment attempt. (note that the message not always exists.
 *          in case of timeout termination, for example, this parameter will
 *          be NULL).
 * Return Value: (-)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Arguments:
 * Input:     hSubs         - The sip stack subscription handle
 *            hAppSubs      - The application handle for this subscription.
 *          eReason       - The reason for a NOTIFY request to be sent
 *          responseCode  - The response code that should be set in the
 *                          NOTIFY message body.
 *          hResponseMsg  - The message that was received on the refer related
 *                          object (provisional or final response).
